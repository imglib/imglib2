/**
 * A {@link NativeType} is a {@link Type} that that provides access to data
 * stored in Java primitive arrays. To this end, implementations maintain a
 * reference to the current storage array and the index of an element in that
 * array.
 *
 * The {@link NativeType} is positioned on the correct storage array and index
 * by accessors ({@link Cursor Cursors} and {@link RandomAccess RandomAccesses}
 * ).
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link NativeType} is the only class that is aware of the actual data
 * type, i.e., which Java primitive type is used to store the data. On the other
 * hand it does not know the storage layout, i.e., how n-dimensional pixel
 * coordinates map to indices in the current array. It also doesn't know whether
 * and how the data is split into multiple chunks. This is determined by the
 * container implementation (e.g., {@link ArrayImg}, {@link CellImg}, ...).
 * Separating the storage layout from access and operations on the {@link Type}
 * avoids re-implementation for each container type.

	 * This method is used by an accessor (e.g., a {@link Cursor}) to request an
	 * update of the current data array.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * As an example consider a {@link CellCursor} moving on a {@link CellImg}.
	 * The cursor maintains a {@link NativeType} which provides access to the
	 * image data. When the cursor moves from one cell to the next, the
	 * underlying data array of the {@link NativeType} must be switched to the
	 * data array of the new cell.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * To achieve this, the {@link CellCursor} calls {@code updateContainer()}
	 * with itself as the argument. {@code updateContainer()} in turn will call
	 * {@link NativeImg#update(Object)} on it's container, passing along the
	 * reference to the cursor. In this example, the container would be a
	 * {@link CellImg}. While the {@link NativeType} does not know about the
	 * type of the cursor, the container does. {@link CellImg} knows that it is
	 * passed a {@link CellCursor} instance, which can be used to figure out the
	 * current cell and the underlying data array, which is then returned to the
	 * {@link NativeType}.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The idea behind this concept is maybe not obvious. The {@link NativeType}
	 * knows which basic type is used (float, int, byte, ...). However, it does
	 * not know how the data is stored ({@link ArrayImg}, {@link CellImg}, ...).
	 * This prevents the need for multiple implementations of {@link NativeType}
