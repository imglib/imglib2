 * {@link RealSum} implements a method to reduce numerical instabilities when

 * problems occur when a small number is added to an already very large sum. In
 * such case, the reduced accuracy of the very large number may lead to the
 * small number being entirely ignored. The method here is Neumaier's
 * improvement of the Kahan summation algorithm.
