/**
 * Java's builtin ThreadLocal has a serious flaw: it can take an arbitrarily long amount of time to
 * dereference the things you had stored in it, even once the ThreadLocal instance itself is no
 * longer referenced. This is because there is single, master map stored for each thread, which all
 * ThreadLocals share, and that master map only periodically purges "stale" entries.
 *
 * <p>While not technically a memory leak, because eventually the memory will be reclaimed, it can
 * take a long time and you can easily hit OutOfMemoryError because from the GC's standpoint the
 * stale entries are not reclaimable.
 *
 * <p>This class works around that, by only enrolling WeakReference values into the ThreadLocal, and
 * separately holding a hard reference to each stored value. When you call {@link #close}, these
 * hard references are cleared and then GC is freely able to reclaim space by objects stored in it.
 *
 * <p>We can not rely on {@link ThreadLocal#remove()} as it only removes the value for the caller
 * thread, whereas {@link #close} takes care of all threads. You should not call {@link #close}
 * until all threads are done using the instance.
