/**
 * This class allows to configure an algorithm for parallelization.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm needs to use the {@link TaskExecutor} returned by
 * {@link Parallelization#getTaskExecutor()} to implement the parallelization.
 * Alternatively it can use {@link Parallelization#getExecutorService()}.
 * But {@link TaskExecutor} is simpler and better suited for image precessing algorithms.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm can be executed singleThreaded, multiThreaded or by
 * using a specified {@link ExecutorService} or {@link TaskExecutor}:
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 *
 *     // Single-threaded call
 *     Parallelization.runSingleThreaded( () -> myAlgorithm( image ) );
 *
 *     // Multi-threaded call
 *     Parallelization.runMultiThreaded( () -> myAlgorithm( image ) );
 *
 *     // ExecutorService
 *     Parallelization.withExecutor( executorService, () -> myAlgorithm( image ) );
 *
 *     // Multi-threaded is the default.
 *     //     A normal function call, that's not somehow wrapped by
 *     //     Parallelization.runSingleThreaded( ... ) runs multi-threaded.
 *     myAlgorithm( image );
 *
 *     // Example Algorithm, that fills an image with ones.
 *     public void myAlgorithm( RandomAccessibleInterval< IntType > image )
 *     {
 *         TaskExecutor taskExecutor = Parallelization.getTaskExecutor();
 *         int numTasks = taskExecutor.suggestNumberOfTasks();
 *         List< Interval > chunks = IntervalChunks.chunkInterval( image, numTasks );
 *
 *         // The TaskExecutor executes the forEach method in multiple threads, if requested.
 *         taskExecutor.forEach( chunks, chunk -> {
 *             for ( IntType pixel : Views.interval( image, chunk ) )
 *                 pixel.setOne();
 *         } );
 *     }
