/**
 * This interface converts a {@link Sampler Sampler&lt;A&gt;} into an instance
 * of {@code B}, where {@code A} and {@code B} are typically {@link Type}s.
 * <p>
 * Its intended use is to create objects that <b>wrap</b> the provided
 * {@code Sampler} itself instead of wrapping values obtained through the
 * {@code Sampler}. In other words, <em>if the {@code Sampler} is pointed at a
 * different object, <b>existing</b> objects returned by this
 * {@code SamplerConverter} should point at it as well</em>.
 * <p>
 * {@code SamplerConverter}s are used in {@link Converters} to create on-the-fly
 * converted images that are both readable and writable. For example, consider
 * accessing a channel of an {@code ARGBType} image as {@code UnsignedByteType}.
 * The converted image needs to provide converted samplers (e.g., {@code
 * RandomAccess<UnsignedByteType>}) that "translate" to the samplers of the
 * original image (e.g., {@code RandomAccess<ARGBType>}).
 * <p>
 * The converted {@code Sampler} returns an {@code UnsignedByteType} instance on
 * {@code get()}. If {@code .setByte(10)} is called on that {@code
 * UnsignedByteType} instance, that must be translated back to the underlying
 * {@code ARGBType}. To achieve this, {@code SamplerConverter.convert(...)}
 * creates a special {@code UnsignedByteType} instance which knows about a
 * specific source sampler (e.g., {@code RandomAccess<ARGBType>}). When the
 * {@code UnsignedByteType} instance is written to (or read from), it gets the
 * current {@code ARGBType} from the source sampler and performs the conversion.
 *
 * @param <A> The type of values accessed by the {@link Sampler}.
 * @param <B> The type of the value returned by this {@link SamplerConverter}.
