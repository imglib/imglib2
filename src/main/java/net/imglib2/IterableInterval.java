 * An {@link IterableRealInterval} whose elements are located at integer

 * An {@code IterableInterval} is <em>not</em> guaranteed to iterate over all

 * hyperrectangular image, it will do so; however, there are some
 * {@code IterableInterval}s which visit only a subset of the {@code Interval}
 * coordinates. For example, the {@code imglib2-roi} library provides means to
 * model regions of interest (ROIs), along with the ability to iterate over
 * coordinates within a particular ROI; see e.g.
 * {@code net.imglib2.roi.labeling.LabelRegion}.
