 * A function over integer space that can create a random access {@link Sampler}.

 *
 * <p>
 * If your algorithm takes a RandomAccessible, this usually means that you
 * expect that the domain is infinite. (In contrast to this,
 * {@link RandomAccessibleInterval}s have a finite domain.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@code RandomAccessible} might be defined only partially. You should be
 * aware of this especially when creating {@link RandomAccessibleInterval}s.
 * While it is straightforward to turn a {@code RandomAccessible} into a
 * {@code RandomAccessibleInterval} by adding interval boundaries via
 * {@link Views#interval}, it is your responsibility to ensure that the
 * {@code RandomAccessible} is fully defined within these boundaries.

	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <em>
	 * Please note: {@link RandomAccessibleInterval}s have a finite domain (their {@link Interval}),
	 * so {@link #randomAccess()} is only guaranteed to cover this finite domain.
	 * </em> This may lead to unexpected results when using {@link Views}. In
	 * the following code
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * RandomAccessible&lt;T&gt; extended = Views.extendBorder( img )
	 * RandomAccessibleInterval&lt;T&gt; cropped = Views.interval( extended, img );
	 * RandomAccess&lt;T&gt; a1 = extended.randomAccess();
	 * RandomAccess&lt;T&gt; a2 = cropped.randomAccess();
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * The {@link RandomAccess access} {@code a1} on the extended image is valid
	 * everywhere. However, somewhat counter-intuitively, the
	 * {@link RandomAccess access} {@code a2} on the extended and cropped image
	 * is only valid on the interval {@code img} to which the extended image was
	 * cropped. The access is only required to cover this interval, because it
	 * is the domain of the cropped image. {@link Views} attempts to provide the
	 * fastest possible access that meets this requirement, and will therefore
	 * strip the extension.
	 *
	 * To deal with this, if you know that you need to access pixels outside the
	 * domain of the {@link RandomAccessibleInterval}, and you know that the
	 * {@link RandomAccessibleInterval} is actually defined beyond its interval
	 * boundaries, then use the {@link #randomAccess(Interval)} variant and
	 * specify which interval you actually want to access. In the above example,
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * RandomAccess&lt;T&gt; a2 = cropped.randomAccess( Intervals.expand( img, 10 ) );
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * will provide the extended access as expected.
