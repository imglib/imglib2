/**
 * Base class for 2D projectors. Projecting means in this case projecting from a
 * source format to a target format. 2D hints that the result is something 2
 * dimensional. The base class provides methods to select a reference point in a
 * multi-dimensional data object. Sub classes like
 * {@link IterableIntervalProjector2D}, {@link SamplingProjector2D} or
 * {@link ArrayImgXYByteProjector} specify a mapping that uses the reference
 * point to project data into a 2 dimensional representation. <br>
 * A basic example is the extraction of a data plain (containing the reference
 * point) by sampling two axes
