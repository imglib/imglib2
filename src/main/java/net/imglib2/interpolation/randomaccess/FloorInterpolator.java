/**
 * {@link RealRandomAccess} to a {@link RandomAccess} by nearest floor
 * interpolation (i.e., the value is sampled at floor(<em>x</em>)).
 *
 * <p>In ImgLib2, the coordinate of a sample corresponds to the 'center' point
 * of the sample, i.e. the location at which the sample was acquired.  This
 * scheme is intuitive in both rasters and irregularly samples data but can
 * trigger confusion when displaying images on a screen with a pixel raster
 * which, in this scheme, spans the range [-0.5,<em>width</em>-0.5].  In the
 * screen-friendly alternative scheme, where sample coordinates reference the
 * top left corner of the pixel rectangle representing a sample the range
 * covered by an image is [0,<em>width</em>], however, coordinate transfer
 * functions other than translation and homogeneous scaling generate different
 * results than in the center-scheme.  Rendering an image using
 * {@link FloorInterpolator} means using the top-left-scheme, rendering it
 * using {@link NearestNeighborInterpolator}, {@link NLinearInterpolator}, or
 * {@link LanczosInterpolator} means using the center-scheme.</p>
